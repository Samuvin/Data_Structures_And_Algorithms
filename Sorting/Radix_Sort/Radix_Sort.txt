Radix sort will be linear if they are in small range

Sort based on digit by digit

Here we have a larger range and the range fall from 0 to base

TC=>Teta(d*(n+b))


d=>every digit
n=>Array elements
b=>Base

If we increase the base b then time reduce but the space will be increase 

We can increase space and reduce time


SC=>Teta(n+b)
