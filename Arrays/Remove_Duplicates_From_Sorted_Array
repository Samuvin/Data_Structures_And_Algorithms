/*
The Intution is we have to keep the count of the before element as In a array First element is always distinct so we start iteration from 1 and we make the res as 1 still now we have one distinct element
after next iteration we have to check the current element with the previous element wheater they are same or not if not same then we found a next distinct element so we need to place the current element in
the res index ad make the res as 1 where res is the index of the next distinct element to be placed and the count of the distinct element
